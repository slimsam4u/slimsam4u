I'd like to work upon random stuff. Mostly Linux based, gaming and side projects. And to fit everything in same channel (atleast to prevent from running out of ideas) Also I like playing Minecraft. And some tweaky works.

You might find some tech tutorials, gaming vids and other vids in my channel. Storms coming, be prepared.
